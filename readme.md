Welcome to my live scores code.

I connected a live score API for European football to display results and information about a match-up.

Currently working on a user friendly front-end to implement this backend to a live web application for friends and family to use! 

Future plan is to host this via Azure as a function connected to a virtualized container so it only uses money when view score button is triggered.
